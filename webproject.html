<p>  The Hippo, formally known as the <i>Hippopotamus Amphibius </i>,is a species of mammal that lives in the Southern region of Africa, and makes its home in the many rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps that fill the area. Although it is a mammal, the name hippopotamus means “water horse” in Latin, as this is where the hippo spends the majority of its time. Hippos are some of the largest land mammals in existence, weighing in at approximately 1.3 tons! One might ask how an animal of this weight is capable of living in the water, as its weight makes it impractical for the creature to swim. But a hippo does not rely on swimming in order to move in the water. Instead it uses its weight as an advantage, sinking to the river floor, where it then hops forward in leaps and bounds. A hippo’s jaw also has enough strength to bite into<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzVLpLwqJcU"> even a car! </A>The only time this strength is on display is when the hippo is fighting predators, feels threatened,  or is fighting another male during mating season. Hippos typically travel in herds, but do not socialize with any of their fellow herd-members. In fact, the only bond that seems to exist within the hippo population at all is that of mother and daughter.

<h2> Diets </h2>
<p> Despite their mean and sturdy looks, hippos are primarily herbivores, their diets including… </p>
<ul>
<li> short grass </li>
<li> small shoots </li>
<li> reeds </li>
<li> Meat*
<br></br>
<ol class="asterick" style="font-size: 10pt"> *Hippos have been known to eat meat, but only during strenuous periods where food is scarce and their diet has been disrupted. When these periods arise , hippos have been confirmed to engage in even cannibalism! This is (fortunately for us) not a sustainable diet for the hippo, as its stomach has trouble digesting it.  </ol>  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Interactions with Humans</h2>
<p> For the uninformed, the hippo may seem like a gentle giant, a relatively innocuous creature that spends its time relaxing in the water.  After all, most of our experiences with the animals only come from cursory glances at zoos, where the hippos are behind glass walls, or in unreachable enclosures. In the wild however, hippos react much differently to humans. They are often aggressive and confrontational, taking a “strike first” approach towards any potential threats. Hippos have been known to capsize boats single-handedly, and are viewed by many African tribes as the most fearsome animal in the land, surpassing even that of the lion.
